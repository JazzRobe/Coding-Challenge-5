# Coding-Challenge-5
ISM3232 Coding Challenge 5.

Introduction: In this challenge, you will create a simple system to manage customer orders for a small coffee shop. The system will track customer orders, calculate the total amount due for each order, check the status of orders, and manage inventory for the coffee shop. Youâ€™ll use objects to represent orders and products, arrays to store multiple orders, and array/object methods to manipulate the data.

Scenario: A coffee shop wants to automate their customer order process. They need a system that: 1. Takes customer orders and adds them to the list of current orders. 2. Calculates the total amount due for each customer based on their order. 3. Manages the inventory, ensuring there are enough products available to fulfill orders. 4. Tracks the status of orders (Pending, Completed).
